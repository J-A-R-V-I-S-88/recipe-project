    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>Chocolate, preferably high quality chocolate such as Ghirardelli</li>
            <li>2 eggs and 2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Combine the butter and chopped chocolate in a double boiler and melt over low heat,</p> 
                <p>stirring until smooth. Alternatively, place the butter and chocolate in a microwave-safe</p>
                <p>bowl and microwave on high, stirring every 30-seconds until melted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt. Beat on medium</p>
                <p>speed until thick and pale yellow.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the melted chocolate mixture and flour into the egg mixture.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fold together the mixture until well combined.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transfer the batter into the prepared ramekins. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the</p>
                <p>sides of the cakes are firm set, but the center is jiggly. Let the cakes cool in the</p>
                <p>ramekins for 1 minute.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Place a small dessert plate over the top of each ramekin and carefully flip it over,</p>
                <p>inverting the chocolate lava cake onto the plate. Let stand for about 10 seconds, then</p>
                <p>remove the ramekin to unmold the cakes. Sift powdered sugar on top and garnish with berries,</p>
                <p>if desired. Serve immediately.</p>
