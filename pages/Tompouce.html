    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Puff Pastry</li>
            <li>Milk (Whole milk is ideal, although anything works)</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Vanilla (Pure vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Begin by making the pastry cream. In a large saucepan, beat the</p>
                <p>egg yolks together, then slowly whisk in the milk. Add sugar and</p>
                <p>cornstarch and whisk until smooth.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heat the pan over medium heat, whisking constantly until the mixture</p>
                <p>is very thick and easily coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the</p>
                <p>heat, then whisk in vanilla paste or vanilla extract.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transfer the mixture to a medium mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap,</p>
                <p>pressing the plastic against the surface of the custard so it doesn't</p>
                <p>form a skin. Cool completely in the refrigerator.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C. Place the puff pastry sheet on a parchment</p>
                <p>paper lined baking sheet and prick the top with the tines of a fork.</p>
                <p>Bake for about 20 to 24 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If it puffs up too much at the start of baking, use a fork to deflate it,</p>
                <p>then lightly press it back down to flatten. Set aside to cool.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cut the baked puff pastry sheet in half using a serrated knife. It should</p>
                <p>be roughly 9 by 6 inches after halving (<strong>the exact dimensions will vary by</strong></p>
                <p><strong>puff pastry brand!</strong>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Place one cooled puff pastry sheet half on a large cutting board. Invert the</p>
                <p>other baked puff pastry half (so the flatter side is facing up). Use a serrated</p>
                <p>knife to cut the inverted half into 8 rectangles, roughly 1 ½ by 4 ½ inches.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Leave the cut rectangles in the same arrangement and set aside. Pre-cutting them</p>
                <p>now will make it easier to portion your tompouce later.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Vigorously whisk the cooled custard to loosen it up, then pipe or spread it over</p>
                <p>the intact baked puff pastry half and smooth out the top.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To make the glaze for your tompouce, whisk together the confectioners' sugar,</p>
                <p>water, and food coloring. Then pour the glaze over the top of the assembled</p>
                <p>pastry and spread it out in an even layer using an offset spatula or the</p>
                <p>back of a spoon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Using the pre-cut top layer of pastry as a guide, use a sharp knife to cut</p>
                <p>through the layers to slice the entire pastry into pieces.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Carefully wipe off the blade between cuts for super clean slices. Allow the</p>
                <p>glaze set a bit before serving or serve immediately.</p>
            </li>
